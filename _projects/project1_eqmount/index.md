For this project, I designed a mount capable of moving a telescope/camera to celestial objects and tracking them as they rotate in the night sky. It uses stepper motors integrated with planetary and strain wave gearboxes to achieve a very high gear reduction (1000:1) in order to increase torque and resolution. Also, it is controlled using a custom PCB, which runs the open source Onstep control software.

### PCB:
