title: Equatorial Mount for Astrophotography
description: Designed a mount capable of moving a telescope/camera to celestial objects and tracking them as they rotate in the night sky. It uses stepper motors integrated with planetary and strain wave gearboxes to achieve a very high gear reduction (1000:1) in order to increase torque and resolution. Also, it is controlled using a custom PCB, which will run the Onstep control system.
